And to Numa, he is rentas from Puerto Rico. And we worked a lot with them and and at that point, I wasn't sure how we're going to include or not include Hollywood type people. Frank with us was a guy that the most famous one at the time was Jane Eddie James Edward James Olmos. And Eddie and I had met James Dolan was at a party and in Washington he was staying with with what's her name who died What's her name? Her husband was Jewish. And but she was she was very active with Hispanics in Washington DC. God was her name. But she was she was wonderful. There's another another. But but we did we did. That wasn't a huge problem at that time, it was just figuring out how to do it. And what to keep them all in mind, which they weren't very happy with some of them. But But it made sense by the name of by what we named our organizations, you can see that we had to get them out because I one of the workshops I put on in that first group was I brought people like Reader's Digest and a bunch of Hispanic or nat or broad national organizations that could do that. And I had a workshop on how to how to get yourself published in these kinds of organizations. And in the room next to me was Edward James Olmos, I think oh yea and I only had about two people show up for mine. And everybody was over there were the stars. Which they packed that other room and I had about two to two people coming into my group. That was perfect. They wanted to go see Eddie Olmos they wanted to go see what was her name, who won all kinds of awards. The actress who, who died not long ago. She was always a maid. Every damn movie she was ever in. She was she was a maid. But we had a lot of fun. But we had to we had a wonderful time forming the first couple of years. And at one one time I mentioned and I don't know whether Frank mentioned about the women that tried to get him fired. Gotta ask him about that over like a $24 bill that he refused to say is legitimate business and sci fi and finally forced him to quit. He just didn't want to put up with that bullshit anymore. But his his thing that he wrote, and I don't know whether you read it yet. How facetious yet I've got it here. Hector has it. We ran it.
